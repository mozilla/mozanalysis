    """Get DataFrames of experiment data; store experiment metadata.

    The methods here query data in a way compatible with the following
    principles, which are important for experiment analysis:

    * The population of clients in each branch must have the same
      properties, aside from the intervention itself and its
      consequences; i.e. there must be no underlying bias in the
      branch populations.
    * We must measure the same thing for each client, to minimize the
      variance associated with our measurement.

    So that our analyses follow these abstract principles, we follow
    these rules:

    * Start with a list of all clients who enrolled.
    * We can filter this list of clients only based on information known
      to us at or before the time that they enrolled, because later
      information might be causally connected to the intervention.
    * For any given metric, every client gets a non-null value; we don't
      implicitly ignore anyone, even if they churned and stopped
      sending data.
    * Typically if an enrolled client no longer qualifies for enrollment,
      we'll still want to include their data in the analysis, unless
      we're explicitly using stats methods that handle censored data.
    * We define a "analysis window" with respect to clients'
      enrollment dates. Each metric only uses data collected inside
      this analysis window. We can only analyze data for a client
      if we have data covering their entire analysis window.

            metric_list: A list of columns that aggregate and compute

                Defaults to False to reduce memory usage of the results.

        Returns:
            A spark DataFrame of experiment data. One row per ``client_id``.
            One or two metadata columns, then one column per metric in

                * branch (str): The client's branch
                * [metric 1]: The client's value for the first metric in

    """Internal object containing various time limits.

    Instantiated and used by the ``Experiment`` class; end users
    should not need to interact with it.

    Do not directly instantiate: use ``TimeLimits.create()``.

    There are several time constraints needed to specify a valid query
    for experiment data:

        * When did enrollments start?
        * When did enrollments stop?
        * How long after enrollment does the analysis window start?
        * How long is the analysis window?

    Even if these four quantities are specified directly, it is
    important to check that they are consistent with the available
    data - i.e. that we have data for the entire analysis window for
    every enrollment.

    Furthermore, there are some extra quantities that are useful for
    writing efficient queries:

        * What is the first date for which we need data from our data
          source?
        * What is the last date for which we need data from our data
          source?

    Instances of this class store all these quantities and do validation
    to make sure that they're consistent. The "store lots of overlapping
    state and validate" strategy was chosen over "store minimal state
    and compute on the fly" because different state is supplied in
    different contexts.
