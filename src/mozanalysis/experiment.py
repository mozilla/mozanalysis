class Experiment(object):
    """Get DataFrames of experiment data; store experiment metadata.

    The methods here query data in a way compatible with the following
    principles, which are important for experiment analysis:

    - The population of clients in each branch must have the same
        properties, aside from the intervention itself and its
        consequences; i.e. there must be no underlying bias in the
        branch populations.
    - We must measure the same thing for each client, to minimize the
        variance associated with our measurement.

    So that our analyses follow these abstract principles, we follow
    these rules:

    - Start with a list of all clients who enrolled.
    - We can filter this list of clients only based on information known
        to us at or before the time that they enrolled, because later
        information might be causally connected to the intervention.
    - For any given metric, every client gets a non-null value; we don't
        implicitly ignore anyone, even if they churned and stopped
        sending data.
    - Typically if an enrolled client no longer qualifies for enrollment,
        we'll still want to include their data in the analysis, unless
        we're explicitly using stats methods that handle censored data.
    - We define a "analysis window" with respect to clients'
        enrollment dates. Each metric only uses data collected inside
        this analysis window. We can only analyze data for a client
        if we have data covering their entire analysis window.
