The `mozanalysis` Python library is a library to standardize experiment analysis
at Mozilla for the purpose of producing decision reports templates that are
edited by data scientists.

## Documentation

Online documentation is available at https://mozilla.github.io/mozanalysis/

##  Installation from pypi
- To install this package from pypi run:
```
pip install mozanalysis
```

## Local Installation
### Dependencies
Dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files, which are used for testing and development respecitvely.
To create a virtualenv and set up the package execute the following, replacing `requirements.txt` with `requirements-dev.txt` if you plan on contributing to the package.
```bash
# Create and activate a python virtual environment.
python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . --no-dependencies
```

## Development
Linting and Formatting are done with Ruff.

When adding new dependencies, add them to the `pyproject.toml` `dependencies` list.  Then generate updated requirements files using the script `script/update_deps`.  [`pip-compile` is called](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) in this script, which uses the specified dependencies to create the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files.  Finally, you'll want to update the requirements in your virtual env by running `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

## Testing locally

### With pytest
Run `pytest` on the commandline from the root of the package file structure.

### with Tox

Tox is included in the dev dependencies.  If you want to run with tox, install the dev dependencies in the `requirements-dev.txt` as detailed above.

You can pass flags to tox to limit the different environments you test in
or the tests you run. Options after `--` or positional arguments are forwarded to pytest.

For example, you can run:

* `tox -e lint` to lint

* `tox -e py310 -- -k utils` to only run tests with "utils" somewhere in the name, on Python 3.10

* `tox tests/test_utils.py` to run tests in a specific file

### with the CircleCI utilities

To test/debug this package locally, you can run exactly the job that
CircleCI runs for continuous integration by
[installing the CircleCI local CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#installing-the-circleci-local-cli-on-macos-and-linux-distros)
and invoking:

```bash
circleci build --job py310
```

See [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/mozilla/mozanalysis/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml)
for the other configured job names (for running tests on different python versions).

## Deploying a new release

Releasing mozanalysis happens by tagging a CalVer based Git tag with the
following pattern:

    YYYY.M.MINOR

where YYYY is the four-digit year number, M is a single-digit month number and
MINOR is a single-digit zero-based counter which does NOT relate to the day of
the release. Valid versions numbers are:

    2017.10.0
    2018.1.0
    2018.12.12

Once the (signed) Git tag has been pushed to the main GitHub repository using
git push origin --tags, Circle CI will automatically build and push a release to
PyPI after the tests have passed.
